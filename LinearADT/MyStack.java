 * A stack only allows elements to be added at the top
 * A stack only allows the current top element to be removed
 * 
 * Add a constructor that creates an empty stack.
 * Add a toString that displays the elements with the 
 * top element first.
 * 
 * @author (your name)
 * @version (a version number or a date)
